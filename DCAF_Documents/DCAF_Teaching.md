Principles
- Once passed selection; all shall pass
    (Exceptions might be; unwilling/unable to invest time to keep up)

- Coaching over criticism
    -- Cadet often has higher demands on self than teacher and might suffer unwarranted low self esteem after a hop that wasn't perfect
    -- Make cadet think ahead
    -- Be constructive; suggest ways cadet can improve by him/helself before next hop (we might offer .miz file for it)

- If possible; keep same instructor for student for the first five hops
